This project draws inspiration from one of Adrian Cantrillâ€™s courses, with the integration of several features and deployment through Terraform to maximize efficiency. The corresponding code repository is attached herewith.
The primary objective of this environment is to ensure high availability, strategically distributed across three distinct availability zones. To accommodate present and future requirements, I opted for an initial /16 network with /20 subnets, providing ample capacity to establish all nine initial subnets and allowing room for potential expansion. I chose to create the VPC inside the eu-west-1 region as its benefits from three different AZs and for lower latency as its location is closer to mine.
As illustrated in the diagram, each availability zone consists of three subnets: Database, Application, and Web. Prioritizing security, the DB and APP subnets are designated as private, and their associated private route tables are linked to a NAT gateway situated in the Web subnet which is public. By doing so, internet connectivity is achievable without exposing the sensitive subnets. It's noteworthy that each availability zone maintains its individual route table and NAT gateway. Although this approach may incur higher costs, its advantage lies in preventing connection disruptions in the event of an availability zone failure. RDS has been used for this project.
Kindly review the attached repository for the code implementation of this architecture.
